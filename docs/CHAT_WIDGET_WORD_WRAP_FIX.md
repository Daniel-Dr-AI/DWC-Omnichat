# Chat Widget Word Wrap Fix

## Problem
The test chat widget was splitting words mid-word, making messages difficult to read.

## Root Cause
The `.message-bubble` CSS class used aggressive word-breaking properties:
- `overflow-wrap: anywhere` - breaks words anywhere, even mid-word
- `word-break: break-word` - breaks words aggressively
- `hyphens: auto` - adds hyphens when breaking words
- `max-width: 70%` - narrow bubbles forced more word breaks

## Solution Applied

Updated the CSS styling in `/workspace/test-chat-widget.html` (lines 186-194):

```css
.message-bubble {
    max-width: 85%;              /* Increased from 70% - allows bubbles to widen */
    padding: 12px 16px;
    border-radius: 18px;
    word-wrap: break-word;       /* Only breaks words as last resort */
    overflow-wrap: break-word;   /* Breaks only when word exceeds container */
    white-space: pre-wrap;       /* Preserves whitespace and line breaks */
    line-height: 1.4;            /* Better readability */
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **Increased max-width**: 70% → 85%
   - Gives bubbles more room to expand horizontally
   - Reduces need for word breaks

2. **Removed aggressive breaking**:
   - Removed `overflow-wrap: anywhere`
   - Removed `word-break: break-word`
   - Removed all `hyphens` properties

3. **Added better text flow**:
   - `word-wrap: break-word` - only breaks when absolutely necessary
   - `white-space: pre-wrap` - respects natural line breaks
   - `line-height: 1.4` - improves readability

## Behavior Now

✅ **Text bubbles will**:
- Widen naturally to fit whole words (up to 85% of chat width)
- Only break words when a single word is too long to fit
- Never exceed the chat window boundaries
- Maintain proper spacing and readability

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Open http://localhost:8000/test-chat-widget.html (or your test widget page)
2. Send messages with various word lengths
3. Verify that:
   - Short words stay on the same line
   - Bubbles expand to accommodate text
   - Long URLs or very long words break only when necessary
   - Text never overflows the chat window
